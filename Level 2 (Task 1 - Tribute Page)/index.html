                    A.P.J. Abdul Kalam (born October 15, 1931, Rameswaram, India—died July 27, 2015, Shillong) Indian
                    scientist and politician who played a leading role in the development of India’s missile and nuclear
                    weapons programs. He was president of India from 2002 to 2007.

                    Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in
                    1958
                    joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). In 1969 he moved to the Indian
                    Space
                    Research Organisation, where he was project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch
                    vehicle
                    that was both designed and produced in India. Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that
                    produced a number of successful missiles, which helped earn him the nickname “Missile Man.” Among
                    those
                    successes was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects
                    of
                    the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.
